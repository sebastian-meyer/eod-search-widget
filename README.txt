Problems:
- The OpenSearch interface of VuFind only returns the top 50 results. There is no paging or any chance of getting more hits.

Ideas:
- Search word suggestions could be enabled.
- Display a loading image while waiting for results.
- Localize the widget.
- Instead of using the OpenSearch interface, a direct call to Solr would be possible, if the server part runs locally at the VuFind host.
